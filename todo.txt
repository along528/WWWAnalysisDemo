save the lines so they can be rescaled?
save a history of the images so that I can draw multiple lines
on the same plot
it would probably be a good idea to save the lines, cuts and bitmaps to the cutitems objects where they can be better managed
the rescaling could be done with the updated bitmaps

it would nice to have it so that if drawing cuts for a an overlapping region that the arrows reflect that


needs to be able to understand logical ORS and ANDS when putting combinations of cuts together.
    If the cuts point in the same direction, then I can only consider one, but it depends on the order of the cuts
    if they point in opposite directions it is an OR if they point away from eachother
    but it is an AND if they point towards eachother.  I have to consider both 
I need to be able to adjust the previous cuts based on the current cuts
