bugs:
   there is a problem in the nsfos plot when cutting at the bin edges
   if I try to do 1<=nsfos<2 it won't redraw, but it will if I do 0<=nsfos<1 or 0<=nsfos<2
   for the latter when I do a print it crashes
   and for the first one, it seems to think the bin edges are the same

save the lines so they can be rescaled?
save a history of the images so that I can draw multiple lines
on the same plot
it would probably be a good idea to save the lines, cuts and bitmaps to the cutitems objects where they can be better managed
the rescaling could be done with the updated bitmaps


Add status bar that indicates things like:
	clear mode
	running mode


Timing and performance
   running over the full signal plus background with no cuts takes about 2 minutes on my computer
   the runtime scales somehow with the efficiency of the cut. So, keeping only 1 and 2 SFOS,
   with a roughly 90% efficiency takes about 1 minute 50 seconds while keeping the 0 SFOS region,
   which is the rest, takes only about 20 seconds. For the 1 and 2 SFOS regions, it would be good 
   to trim out some of the diboson events, which would improve the speed without affecting the estimate much.
   But for the 0 SFOS region I likely need these statistics.  I might want to make it smart enough to choose the appropriate
   input based on the selection

   running on data is essentially instantaneous

I don't seem to be reproducing the signal and background yields well at all.  I also need to be careful not to scale the fake estimate by the luminosity, and 
I need to apply the diboson k-factors appropriately.


move wzbg.root,zzbg.root fakebg.root and otherbg.root to local and then filter with 3lep cut
